                    <p class="main-text">
                        My project idea is to build a system for planning routes through hazardous areas, for robots and drones. This would utilize a neural network to analyse drone footage and gyroscopic data, recording the terrain as a 3D model, which is used to plot a safe path for more expensive drones to follow.
                        In the modern age, some workplace hazardous areas have been deemed too dangerous for human exposure. As a result, highly sophisticated robotic drones are sent in to complete tasks, under the remote guidance of a trained operator. Were there to be an accident during works, these drones would be a very costly asset for the company to have destroyed. They may also even be the cause of these accidents at times, by failing to avoid certain objects, or stumbling into sensitive areas of a plant room. My product allows operators to accurately pre-plan the logistics of their work, with inexpensive drones that can be considered expendable in dangerous situations.
                        This product would consist of a drone with a camera and gyroscopic sensor, both integrated with the drone body. For specialized situations (i.e. Working near corrosive gasses, high temperatures, radiation, etc.), tailored attachments may be added to the drone for extended capability. These sensors will wirelessly feed back to the operators PC, where a pr-trained AI generates a 3D model of the space. Machine learning algorithms would be used to identify important terrain features, obstacles, and hazards. Finally, an A* algorithm would be used to calculate the most effective path through the field. Areas which present a higher risk to enter will be calculated as having a higher movement cost than safer zones. This path can either be used by the operator directly to control their maintenance drone, or they may choose to export the path as a CSV outlining vector movement commands. Should the operator choose to automate this process, it must be ensured that their maintenance drone is correctly configured to read the command list. In order to achieve maximum accuracy in every situation, the program would need to include a neural network capable of identifying objects, based on photographic sample data which is specific to that particular area.
                        This project is relatively light on hardware materials. The greatest hardware challenge will be finding motors and a drone enclosure which are rated for use within hazardous areas. All wiring and installation of electrical parts must be compliant with all hazardous area standards. Mounted to the drone there is to be a camera, battery pack, motors, gyroscope, and microcontroller with internal Wi-Fi capability. The microcontroller (let us assume Arduino for now) would use a C++ Arduino Wi-Fi library to feed these back to a USB receiver, which plugs into one of the users COM ports. To receive signals on the operator PC, the C# ‘System.IO.Ports’ library is easily able to receive serial communication from a microcontroller. From here, Tensorflow-Sharp allows us to use pre-trained machine learning models to analyse the data stream, and convert it to a 3D model, complete with all flagged areas and obstacles. To build and train these networks, we can simply use Tensorflow with python, and keep the trained file to be transferred to the Unity build. Once the neural network has converted the data into a 3D object, it is able to apply the NavMesh class to our digital terrain, which outlines all accessible and inaccessible areas. Before A* (pathfinding) is performed, movement cost of NavMesh areas must be updated to reflect the risk levels of a maintenance drone entering them. If a particular hazard makes one area 10 times more dangerous than another to cross, then it should have movement cost modifier of 10 times greater. An area regarded as being completely safe should have a movement cost of zero. This ensures that the algorithm will calculate the safest route, with no regard to what the shortest route may be. Also note that a mobile phone has all hardware capabilities required to simulate the drone. An alternate design, which sends video and gyroscopic data from a mobile device to the operator PC would be sufficient for prototyping most of the software outlined in this design document.
                        In building this device, many software and hardware development skills would be required. Finding a pre-built drone which blueprint, with hazardous area suitability, that can be added to would save a lot of structural design work. With the drone itself being pre-designed, CAD skills are required to modify the device to fit the extra hardware. The camera and gyroscope must be wired to the microcontroller, using all skills necessary for intrinsically safe wiring. Programming and math skills are necessary for building and training the model file in python, creating the backend for the PC application, and programming the microcontroller. Finally, UI design skills are important for creating a polished and streamlined user experience.
                        Should this project succeed, it would revolutionise the way we approach pathfinding inside hazardous areas. The ability to accurately pre-plan safe paths means less accidents, and less money lost per accident. In essence, this means lower insurance costs for businesses, and greatly less severe consequences for failure during maintenance and inspections.
