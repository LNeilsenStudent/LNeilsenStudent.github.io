                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">What is my interest in IT and when/how did it start?</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">My interest in IT started when a friend taught me how to install Linux, and play around with python when I was around the age of 13. Since then, I have encountered IT quite a lot through my career as a high voltage/protection technician, in the form of complex test equipment, programming and fault-finding digital relays and PLC’s, as well as the use of deep-analysis software. In my personal life, I have used C# through Unity game engine to explore the concepts of OOP. I have also used python extensively for processing and analyzing data.

                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">So, why did I choose RMIT?</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">I chose RMIT as I know it to be a large university, with a wide range of facilities, and ample funding. RMIT was also an easy selection for me, as the enrolment position was readily available, and recommended by Open Universities.

                    <p class="main-text"> Ideally, upon completion of this course, I would like to work for Omicron as a C++ developer.

                    <p class="main-text">This job involves working in team, to design and develop test equipment for high-voltage power networks, and their associated protection systems. The reason this position appeals to me is because I have extensive field experience using their equipment. I really enjoyed working with their equipment, and providing feedback to their team in Germany, to assist in creating a user experience that was suitable for our use in the Northern Territory. As a result, I would love to see the other side of that process, and work with people from all around the world to deliver first class software solutions to a dynamic range of complex problems in the field of electrical testing.

                    <p class="main-text">This position calls for a well-rounded programmer, who can work effectively with C++ in a team situation.

                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">My relevant existing skills:</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">Currently, my communication and teamwork skills are sufficient for a position such as this. I am able to clearly and decisively communicate ideas, while listening to and considering the contributions of others. I am highly meticulous in my work, and organisation of information is hugely important to me. Aside from these skills, I have previous work experience in a related field, and have an introductory understanding to how these teams work with field operatives to refine their product.
                        As I have studied power systems previously, I have a solid understanding of what this software is trying to achieve, and what constitutes a quality device.
                        In regards to C++, I have a basic knowledge of the language, and a deep understanding of .NET using C#.

                    <p class="main-text">The primary skill I need to build upon is my understanding and implementation of C++. As C++ is a complex language with a diverse functionality, it must be studied deeply if one wishes to utilize it effectively and efficiently.
                        I also desire a more rounded, holistic understanding of IT before applying for this role. This would allow me to work more freely, with fewer time-consuming knowledge barriers in my daily workflow.

                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">My personality tests:</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">In order to gain a deeper understanding or my workplace strengths and weaknesses, I have contucted 3 different types of personality tests on myself. The three tests that I used were 
                        <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">Myer-Briggs: 16 personality types</a>, 
                        <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Learning Styles test</a>, and

                        <a href="personality.html">test results for all three tests.</a>
                        </p>                    
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <hr class="regular-horizontal-line"></hr>
                    <!--segment-->
                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">What these test results mean to me:</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">Between the Myer-Briggs and the Big Five tests, the most emphasised part of my personality appears to be openness of ideas. Career recommendations for my Myer-Briggs personality type (INTJ-A) appear to trend toward science, research, and technology. As a result, I feel that I am suited to working in the field of IT.
                        The Big Five test highlighted that I have a moderately low extraversion trait (58%). This is important to be aware of, because it can lead to insular work patterns which can be harmful when trying to work cohesively in a team.
                        Despite the low extraversion having a potential to negatively impact my ability to work in a group, my learning styles test suggests that I have a lot to gain from working in a team. Group work, and group discussions tend to include a large amount of auditory sharing of information (my auditory score: 30%), as well as a component of practical hands-on work (my tactile score: 55%). As my learning style test only scored my visual learning ability at 15%, reading information alone is likely the worst way for me to effectively retain information.                      
                        </p>                    
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <hr class="regular-horizontal-line"></hr>
                    <!--segment-->
                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">How is this likely to effect my teamwork capabilities?</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">
                        Due to the high openness score alongside the INTJ-A result, I feel that I have a strong ability to take relevant ideas into consideration, while thinking outside the box to find a solution. Despite these skills having a positive synergy, INTJ-A has the potential to hinder openness at times – especially when the low extraversion is bought into consideration. If I were to fall into the trap of being unaware of these traits, I may be inclined to withdraw from group discussions, in favour of seeking out the solution on my own.

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <hr class="regular-horizontal-line"></hr>
                    <!--segment-->
                    <h3 class="paragraph-heading">How can this be accounted for when forming a team?</h3>
                    <p class="main-text">
                        INTJ-A suggests that I have the capacity to be a valuable group member, with unique insights. The low extraversion, and desire to think undisturbed can sometimes lead to self-isolation from group tasks. A clear establishment of leadership and order within the team is the most important thing for me, when organising a team. This order circumvents the risk of withdrawal from the group. Whether I am in a position of leadership or not, this enforces the responsibility on all members of the team to come together and share ideas. It also prevents power struggles between group members, reducing the risk of interpersonal drama, in turn reducing the desire to complete tasks alone.
