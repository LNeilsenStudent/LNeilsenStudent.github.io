        <h3>Lachlan Neilsen - Team Leader</h3>
        <main>
        <h4>Personal Information</h4> 
          <p>Student Number: S3987677</p>  
          My name is Lachlan Neilsen, I am a High Voltage Tester, and I have recently commenced Bachelor of IT with RMIT.
          I am a slightly introverted, open-minded worker with a primarily hands-on learning style. I got a keen interest 
          in learning IT when one of my friends showed me how to install Linux and play around with Python. Since then I
          have used python extensively for processing and analysing data and have gained knowledge of core concepts of OOP.
        <h4>Team Profile</h4> 
          I am a slightly introverted, open-minded worker with a primarily hands-on learning style. My greatest strength 
          (as highlighted by Myer-Briggs) is my persistent need for clear, decisive answers. As an INTJ-A personality type, 
          I pay great attention to detail, and as a result I usually complete tasks at a very high standard. My Greatest 
          weakness (as highlighted by Big 5 results) is a relatively low extraversion, coupled with 69% neuroticism. If care 
          is not taken this could lead to insular work patterns, and disproportionate doubt in my work.

        <h3>Alex Milnes</h3>
        <main>
        <h4>Personal Information</h4> 
          <p>Student Number: S3987656</p>
          My name is Alex, I am 30, I have relocated to Brasilia, Brazil, and I love it. I am a loving husband and Father of 
          twin boys with another set of twins on the way. I am Australian, born and raised in Sydney. I have studied after school; 
          my significant achievement is attaining the Diploma of Security and Risk Management, which created my interest in information 
          technology. I am a native English speaker and can speak Portuguese at an intermediate level; this has helped me professionally 
          and has created many opportunities. I am interested in physical activities and team sports. I like to read about politics 
          and economics, but I mostly enjoy sports, Cricket and Rugby being my favourites. 
        <h4>Team Profile</h4>
          The test results opened my eyes to my attributes, and I was unaware of some traits the test claimed I had. I felt very 
          accomplished with the result such as “humanitarian”, “innovator”, and “caretaker”, which I believe are very authentic. 
          However, I was also taken aback by such claims of being “judging”; until now, I believed I did not display this trait. 
          It would influence my behaviour positively due to claims that I am a “humanitarian” and a “caretaker”. I am a team player 
          and willing to perform any task assigned. I believe I would excel at speaking and writing tasks due to having prior 
          experience with this before, where Git and GitHub skills I found difficulty with, but I am doing extra study to compensate.

        <main>
        <h4>Personal Information</h4> 
          <p>Student number is s3992802</p>
          My name is Christopher Box, I'm 42 years of age and live in Newcastle, NSW. I work at Telstra, in a team managing outages related 
          to landlines, and the customer faults affected by those outages. My hobbies include gaming, technology/gadgets, travel and astronomy/
          astrophotography. My interest in IT began at a young age, when I began gaming on a computer at Dad's work. This developed over the 
          years into also building PCs, networks, and troubleshooting technical issues for friends and family. 
        <h4>Team Profile</h4>  
          My Myers-Briggs Test outcome is 'ISTJ-T Logistician', which means practical, fact-minded and reliable. I work best with some structure
          and leadership, and am reliable in a role that requires me to complete defined tasks to a clear schedule. My learning Style Test 
          outcome 'Visual Learner', which means that I remember what I see over what I hear and that I prefer to read/write rather than listen 
          to information. In my group I would learn best using visuals such as a shared whiteboard - Trello in our case. Team Roles Test 
          outcome 'Completer, Team Player, Expert', which means the top 3 roles in a group that suit me best are: at the end of a task, 
          to polish and scrutinise the work for errors; diplomacy, team cohesion and helping others; being trusted to complete specific 
          tasks working alone.

          a strong focus on what's happening or likely to happen. I will bring a high-level of organizion but also an even temper and 
          a resistant to stress. My Learning styles test shows that I learn best through hands-on experience and that I get a lot of satisfaction 
          building things. My big-5 test shows that I bring concientiousness to my team and that I strive for high achievement.

        <main>
          <h4>Personal Information</h4>
          <p>Student Number: S3338810</p> 
          My name is Sjoukje Ida Gange usually called Ida. My hobbies include reading, making many craft items including quilts, plushies, 
          clothes, books and bookbinding and I am now teaching myself leather work. I have qualifications in Information Science and 
          Technology and I worked for many years in Information Management, however my work was becoming more and more technology oriented. 
          Since I very much enjoyed this aspect of my work and wanted to learn more, I enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology 
          with OUA/RMIT. 
          <h4>Team Profile</h4> 
          According to 16 personalities I am an Advocate and a good diplomat. 
          However, being inclined to perfectionism, I need to be careful not to impose my expectations on my team members. According 
          to the VARK test I am mostly a visual learner although I also score highly with read/write skills and on the Big 5, I score 
          very low on Extraversion and other qualities related to social skills which means that I need to work hard to develop 
          relationships with other team members.
