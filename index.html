                    <p class="main-text">My name is Lachlan Neilsen, and I a have recently commenced Bechelor of IT with RMIT. I was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1996 on the first day of winter (what a warm welcome to the world). Since then, I have lived in many places, and worked in many roles around the country. I live with my partner Christine, and my petulant four-legged children, Satan and Lilith (cat and dog).</p>
                    <p class="main-text">Currently my primary qualification is as an electrician, with my main fields of work having been HV (high voltage) testing, testing and maintaining HV protection networks, and electronic diagnosis, repair, and design. Years of working in the electrical field, while learning (and loving) programming on the side, has finally resulted in my decision to make this huge career shift.

                        My interest in programming came originally from learning C++ for Arduino (non-professional robotics). From there, I learned Unity (C#) for game development, Python for solving complex number problems and building neural networks, and a whole bunch of smaller languages along the way. Aside from programming, I have done a lot of general design work, including 2D & 3D art/rigging/animation, vector image processing, video editing, sound generation and editing, etc.
                        
                        My goal in entering this course (and the industry) is to build on my programming skills and knowledge, and combine them with my working understanding of electrical/electronics. Ultimately, I would like to build niche products (software/hardware) for the automation and optimization of complex tasks in other industries.
                        
                        I am really excited to get to know everyone, and dive further into the world of IT.
